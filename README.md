### Greetings! 

Welcome to my GitHub site.  The most important stuff (the more sophisticated projects, a.k.a., "portfolio" repos) is still primarily "work in progress". However, you can also find (1) less advanced work related to the many classes I've taken since spring 2020 and (2) some "demo" repos showing some examples of code I've done completely outside GitHub.
