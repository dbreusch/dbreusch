### Greetings! 

Welcome to my GitHub site.  Here you will find a mix of (1) some not-very-exciting repos related to classes I've taken, (2) some "demo" repos showing some examples of code I've done completely outside GitHub and (3) some work-in-progress "portfolio" repos for more sophisticated projects.
